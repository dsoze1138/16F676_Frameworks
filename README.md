16F676_Frameworks
===================

This repository contains some experimental frameworks use for code development targeting the Microchip PIC16f676 controller.

The first project (16F676_stepper_v550.X) will interface the PIC16F676 controller with a ULN2003 driver board and the 28BYJ-48 5 volt stepper motor.

Please see [link](https://lastminuteengineers.com/28byj48-stepper-motor-arduino-tutorial/) at Last Minute Engineers for the Control 28BYJ-48 Stepper Motor with ULN2003 Driver & Arduino tutorial. This project is a lame port of the basic functionality of this Arduino project, support for acceleration profiles may come with the fullness of time.
